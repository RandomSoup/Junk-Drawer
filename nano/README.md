# Nano patches

Just a few patches for [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), currently all based on commit 86108570.

- `blueless.patch` turns all blue syntax into cyan
- `tab-align.patch` makes tabs automatically align to the previous line (does not effect tab with a marked region, or M-tab)
- `relative-browser.patch` makes the browser default to the directory of the open file instead of the directory nano was ran from
